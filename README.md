# Club Ledger App Project

## Introduction
This is a project for NeighborHood Hacks hosted by Major League Hacking (MLH).

The motivation for this project was to create a website that hosts a simple Ledger that a club or a group\
can use to finance their budgets and fundings. The website also holds a list of members, active and\
inactive, and when an inactive member is turned to an active member (presumably by paying $20 membership\
fee), the membership fee is automatically added to the budget of the club. The website is for those\
having hard time managing their clubs' budgets. 

## How to use
Refer to README.md file located at both client and server folder to set up both front and back environment.\
The description and the amount of transaction (positive amount for income, negative amount for expense) can\
be put to create new transaction of the club.

For flexibility, each transaction can be deleted, even the auto-generated ones from membership fee.

New member can be created with a new name, and he/she will start as an inactive member. Click the activation\
button to activate new member. The member will become inactive again once one month from the activation date\
has passed.

Deleting a member is also possible if needed.

## Current public build
Currently, the project is in public domain, powered by Linode (https://www.linode.com).
